# App launcher & fuzzy match

`AppIndex.scan()` runs off-main, enumerates the standard `/Applications` dirs, and dedups by bundle ID
(first dir wins).

`FuzzyMatch.score` is a tiered scorer: exact → prefix → substring / word-start → subsequence with
consecutive / word-boundary bonuses. `LauncherRankingStore` then adds a bounded, query-specific
frecency boost (frequency plus decaying recency). The boost can reorder results within a relevance
tier but cannot make a weaker match kind beat a stronger one. Matching strips invisible Unicode
format scalars first, since app metadata can contain bidi/zero-width markers before the visible name.

Selecting a launcher result records every prefix of the submitted query, so choosing WhatsApp for
`wha` also teaches `w` and `wh`. Direct hotkeys and empty-query favorites do not affect learned
ranking. Learned data stays on device in `launcher-ranking.json`; a result that has learned ranking
offers a per-item reset in its Actions menu, and users can clear all learned ranking in General
Settings.

Rankings are memoized one query deep and keyed by the ranking store's revision, so a launch or reset
invalidates the cached order. `rank` resolves the whole learned table for a query up front via
`boosts(query:)` — one fold and one clock read per pass, not per candidate.

The ranking harness covers prefix learning, frequency/recency scoring, persistence, and both reset
paths; see the command in `development.md`.

Icons go through a count-capped `NSCache` (`IconCache`).

## Uninstall Application

Application actions include a guarded uninstall flow. Bettercast identifies the app bundle by its path and bundle ID, checks common per-user remnants in Application Support, Caches, Containers, Group Containers, preferences, saved state, logs, WebKit, HTTP storage, and user launch agents, then shows the exact paths before confirmation. The app and confirmed user files are moved to the Trash, not permanently deleted. Running apps are asked to quit first. System-owned remnants are reported but left untouched when administrator authorization would be required.

Matching is conservative: Bettercast uses exact bundle-ID/name matches and does not recursively sweep arbitrary home-directory data. This avoids the dangerous false positives that generic name-based cleanup can cause.

## Reveal in Finder

Application and System Settings results expose **Show in Finder** in their ⌘K Actions menu and on
**⌘↵**. Synthetic command results do not have a filesystem location, so the shortcut is unavailable
for them.

## Quitting apps

`RunningAppsMonitor` (live from `NSWorkspace` launch/terminate notifications) drives both the row's
running dot and the availability of the quit actions:

- **Quit Application** — the last row of an app's ⌘K Actions menu, shown only while that app is
  running. `AppLauncher.quit(bundleID:)` terminates every instance of the bundle and reports whether
  anything was running; the palette only dismisses when something was, and it restores focus unless
  the app it just quit *was* `previousApp`.
- **Quit All Applications** — a `CommandRegistry` command. `AppLauncher.quitAllTargets()` is the
  policy (every `.regular` app except Finder — `terminate()` only relaunches it — and Bettercast,
  excluded by PID because About/Settings temporarily flips it to `.regular`). `AppCore.quitAllApps()`
  resolves that list **once**, confirms it with an `NSAlert`, then terminates exactly what was
  confirmed. The palette hides before the alert — it is a floating panel and would sit above it.

Both quits are graceful `NSRunningApplication.terminate()`, so an app with unsaved work still puts up
its own save sheet.

The ⌘K menu samples `isRunning` **once, when it opens** (`RootPaletteView.openActions()`), so an app
launching or quitting elsewhere can't add or drop the Quit row while the menu is up — the same freeze
the rest of the menu already has ([palette.md](palette.md)). Only `LauncherList` observes
`RunningAppsMonitor` live, for the running dot.
